Station 13</B></FONT><BR>By: Tolth</P>

<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Overview</B><BR>Space Station 13 was
written for BYOND. Like many BYOND games, it is two dimensional with
a top down view and runs terribly. It uses tile-based movement. Space
Station 13 (or SS13 for short) starts you on a space station orbiting
a very peculiar gaseous planet in a binary star system. Each round
type is centred around a specific type of disaster, ranging from a
meteor shower to a traitor within the crew. The game is constantly
being developed, so new modes are added all the time!</P>
<HR>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Objectives</B><BR>The primary
objective in most modes of Space Station 13 is survival. You must try
to stay alive long enough to escape on the evacuation shuttle. This
doesn't mean you should immediately rush to the escape dock and wall
yourself in; half the fun is in trying to keep the station running
for as long as possible. Exactly how you do this is up to you and
your assigned job.</P>

A deadly mutagenous virus has been released and the crew must fight a
green mass for control of the station. The blob spreads quickly, and
only the sacred welder can fight it back! (Unless it spawns in the
engine and dies instantly.)</SPAN></P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR><B>Traitor</B> - In traitor mode
there is a traitor aboard the space station!!! The traitor is
assigned a random objective, from escaping alone to stealing the
captain's jumpsuit. The objective of everyone else is to stop the
traitor and survive!</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">PROTIP: THE TRAITOR SPAWNS WITH A RADIO
THAT IS THE BEST WAY TO IDENTIFY HIM IF CAPTURED.<BR><BR><B>Meteor</B>
&ndash; In Meteor, the station is threatened by a meteor shower. The
objective is to do your best to repair and maintain the station, and
eventually escape.</P>

mode a deadly mutagenous virus has been released and the crew must
fight small underdeveloped primates for control of the station. The
monkey's bite is deadly, and anyone bitten will soon join the primate
horde.</P>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Getting around</B><BR>The interface
for Space Station 13 is largely click driven. To use something, you
will almost always click or double click.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR><B>Getting Started (A Quick
jump-start guide to get into the game)</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; font-weight: medium">Select your
preferences using the character setup command and then use ready to
enter the game.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm">If you do this after the game has
started you will spawn as an assistant; otherwise, a vague guide to
the jobs you may choose follows.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><B>Assistant </B><BR><BR>You'll spawn
as this if you enter after a game has started. Assistants have a very
low-access ID card, and really nothing else. They don't however have
any duties, so this can be a pretty good way to learn the layout of
the station if you join midway through a round. It's really not worth
choosing this, though.<BR><BR><B>Atmospheric Technician </B><BR><BR>This
involves looking after the atmospheric systems on the station, as you
can probably guess. In theory, you'll be checking the air composition
of the station with an analyzer and making sure that it's not going
to kill people. In reality, you'll be cleaning up the constant gas
spills caused by griefers and the traitor via use of the pipe filters
in the maintenance tunnel (which are pretty self-explanatory) and the
portable filters that are around the station and in Atmospheric
Storage. This is probably the easiest job for a new player, so jump
in as this and getting a feel for the station layout and the basic
workings of the game before you try anything else. <BR><BR><B>Medical
Doctor </B><BR><BR>Pretty much self explanatory. Grab a Medkit, and
either patrol the station treating the gassed/beaten crewmembers who
will be lying around within 20 minutes of any game starting or stay
in Medical and heal the people who get dragged in. More advanced
medical is explained in weasello's guide below.<BR><BR><B>Station
Engineer </B><BR><BR>This can be one of the more technical jobs, but
it doesn't take a huge amount of time to learn. Basically, the
Engineers handle the engine itself (which involves keeping it fed
with plasma, igniting it, and so on.) and the repair of the station.
Weasello's stuff has a reasonably good guide to the basics of this,
and you should be able to work the rest out by jumping on one of the
empty servers and tinkering about for twenty minutes or so. This
isn't a bad place to start, but messing up with the engines can kill
every single person on the station so be fucking careful.<BR><BR><B>Security
Officer </B><BR>Open your locker, grab a stun baton and then patrol
the station and hit people. That's it.<BR>PROTIP: KILLING PEOPLE OR
BEING A DICK WILL GET YOU BANNED</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR><B>Toxin Researcher </B><BR>Toxin
researchers are essentially the bombmakers. Weasello's guide has a
reasonably complex explanation of what you're supposed to do here,
but basically you'll be heating plasma and assembling bomb circuitry.
Security and the AI will almost certainly be keeping a close eye on
you if you choose to do this, so I'd you play around a bit with Atmos
and get some experience before trying this.<BR><BR><B>Forensic
Technician </B><BR>Seriously, don't bother with this. It's arguably
the most boring job of all, and can be one of the most annoying to
get to grips with. Forensic Techs take fingerprints from people and
objects and check them against their records. That's pretty much it.
With the relatively short length of games on the goon server, this
isn't really worth doing in itself, as any security man can be a
Forensic Tech if needed. <BR><BR><B>Genetic Researcher </B><BR>This
is pretty much the most complex job on the station. Don't touch this
until you've played for a while. Genetic researchers can directly
edit the DNA of other players and monkeys, and as such can bring
people back to life, change their skin colour, or turn a human into a
monkey or vice versa. It's all far too complex and annoying to be
worth typing out here. There's probably a more complex guide for this
around, go find it if you REALLY want to do this.<BR><BR><B>Chaplain
</B><BR>AARHGFHGHGH I FUCKING LOVE TO PRAY<BR><BR><B>Head of
Research.</B><BR><BR>The Head of Research essentially administers
Medical and Toxins research and has an ID-card with quite high
access. This isn't really a good choice at all for a new player as it
implies a degree of experience with the game. Practically, you'll be
helping out Toxins and Medical and occasionally being attacked for
your ID card.<BR><BR><B>Head of Personnel </B><BR>This one really is
only for players with a little bit of experience. The Head of
Personnel is in charge of Security and managers the positions of the
people on the station; they have access to the personnel records and
can edit the ID cards and thus positions of crewmembers as they wish.
They also start next to a locker which contains a laser pistol, which
can be useful for a traitor or in self defense. Traitors will often
target the HoP for his ID card and special equipment, as well.<BR><BR><B>AI
</B><BR>Don't do this. It carries a huge amount of power as well as
massive limitations, as the AI is bound by Asimov's laws. The AI can
control any of the electrical systems on the station, including the
air supply, engine blast doors and power. Making a stupid mistake as
the AI will very possibly kill several people, so stay away from this
until you have a little bit of experience with the game.<BR><BR><B>Captain
</B><BR>Self explanatory. An all-access ID card, total power over the
crew, guns and a personal teleporter. ABSOLUTELY DO NOT DO THIS UNTIL
YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE WITH THE GAME OR YOU WILL PISS OFF OTHER
PLAYERS.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><SPAN STYLE="font-style: normal"><B>Movement</B></SPAN><BR>Movement
on SS13 is only in the 4 cardinal directions. The diagonal directions
throw/drop items, switch hand/modes. If you move into a dense object
you first try to push it. Not all items can be pushed. You can also
right click on an object and select 'pull' and then every movement
you make will ttempt to drag that object behind you. If you wish to
stop pulling you must go onto your on-screen display and find the
object with a person in a box. Click on it and you will stop pulling.
If you ever desire to make sure of which direction you are facing use
.center and then try to move what direction you want to
face.<BR><I><B>'Equipping'</B></I><BR>You 'equip' items in SS13 by
picking them up. In order to pick an item up all you must do is
attack it with a free hand. Now you hae two hands. Which hand is
being used is indicated by the blue button in the lower-left area of
your HUD. You can change hands by clicking the hand button or
pressing the .northeast macro. You can then also then transfer that
item to another part of your body. In order to do this you just
attack the green box (or blue storage box) on your hud that you would
like to move it to. In order to 'unequip' a equipped item that is not
in your hand. Get a free hand and attack the item. Then in order to
drop an item in your hand (and make it a free hand again) click the
drop button (or throw to throw the item wherever you are
facing).<BR><I><B>Talking</B></I><BR>Talking on SS13 is still via the
say verb so the normal say speech bubble on the command line will
still work. Please note however that you can whisper. More on this in
the items selection under radio, intercoms, and headsets. There are a
lot of emotes that are accessed by preceding your text with a '*'. To
view a list of available emotes for your character use the type
'*help' into the say menu. To speak via your headset use a semicolon
after say &ldquo;.<BR><I><B>Taking Items/Giving Items</B></I><BR>You
can take items from people by dragging their mob onto your mob. A
screen will pop up. From this screen you can select an object to
remove from them. If you select a 'Nothing' slot then you will
attempt to equip that slot with the object you are holding. 
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm"><I><B>Death</B></I><BR>If you are dead
then you can use the watch verb to look through the eyes of another
mob. Depending on circumstances you can use abandon mob to restart
(leaving that box blank gives you a random name). A dead person hears
everything that is said but might not hear all attack messages.</P>
